# Credits

- This project is started from the [egui template](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/) and most of the setup and structure is still as they set it up.
- It is heavily inspired by the plots part of the [egui demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo).
- The good people in the [egui discord](https://discord.com/invite/JFcEma9bJq) that provided guidance and invaluable assistance.
- [Beixuan Yang](http://beixuanyang.com/) for her assistance with the math for the plot boundaries reset.

This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are very good reasons to include both as noted in
this [issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) on [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org)'s repo.
